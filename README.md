fluxx_api_toolkit_java
======================

Java library and reference code for utilizing the http://fluxx.io REST API

To use within a Maven build system project add this block to your pom.xml:

        <dependency>
            <groupId>io.fluxx</groupId>
            <artifactId>fluxx-api</artifactId>
            <version>0.5.1</version>
        </dependency>

Note, there is a skeleton project under the 'example' folder of this repository

To use the REST API, you'll need to generate an API key and secret from https://[fluxx instance hostname]/oauth/applications page of your target Fluxx instance

Customized documentation for your instance can be found at https://[fluxx instance hostname]/api/rest/v1/doc
